Tic-tac-toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns marking an empty space with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. When all nine spaces are full, the game is over, or if no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
